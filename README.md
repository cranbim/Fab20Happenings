# Fab20Happenings
For the online version of the Happenings event as part of Fringe Arts Bath (FAB) 2020, I have created a web based, webcam driven experience.
This experience, called Otherwhere Elsewhen, uses time and space displacment of the viewers image to explore the mediated version of *here* and *now* as they occur in video and other digitally facilitated communications during the Cornovirus crisis.
Created in P5.js
